APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats) have changed the world of enterprise security and how networks and organizations are attacked. These threats, and the cyber-criminals behind them, are experts at remaining hidden from traditional security while exhibiting an intelligence, resiliency, and patience that has never been seen before.

While no single solution will solve the problem of advanced threats on its own, next-generation security provides the unique visibility and control of, and the true integration of, threat-prevention disciplines needed to find and stop these threats — both known and unknown.
